# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
Seeing how document.getElementById() connects JavaScript to specific HTML elements helped the most. Updating textContent made it clear how JavaScript directly changes what the user sees on the page.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I chose milestones that felt natural as the number of clicks increased. The messages gradually become more humorous to reflect repeated user interaction.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?
I initially forgot to update the counter display after incrementing the variable, which caused the number not to change visually even though the logic was correct.

## What personal twist did you add?
I added background color changes at certain milestones to make the interaction feel more dynamic and rewarding.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
Fitness apps, mobile games, and social media notifications use similar event-driven interactions where user actions immediately trigger feedback.
